# Introduction

Value Pipes are functions responsible for modification of values 
generated by [Value Generators](../../Building-Blocks/03_value-generator.md).

Each Value Pipe can be described as this:

``` typescript
type ValuePipe = (value: GeneratedValue): GeneratedValue 
```

This means the Value pipe is only performing some post-generation modifications
to the value. Actually, this generated value is then returned.
