# About project

The name chosen for this project is a composition of words ***Falsum*** and ***Fabricate*** - simply
to indicate the intended purpose - to enable the client to generate any random data by declaring
just how the output data should look like - by providing a simple JSON-like schema.

Currently, it's main aim is to enhance a mocking and preparation tools; with future extension to
other ecosystems to enhance the developer experience.


## Motivation

> _I believe every developer needs to focus on turning his awesome ideas into implementation, 
not to spend hours on preparing and updating his data base for testing the masterpiece._

Motivation to build up this ecosystem was to provide the ability to create a data system in
the easiest possible manner - for development and testing.


## Requirements

This project is built on top of base Node.js with TypeScript and is meant primarily for Node-based applications with 
possible usage at static client-side applications with embedded JavaScript code.

To remain as lightweight as possible, to use the base framework you only need to have virtually any JavaScript runtime 
environment - no matter if it's a Node.js or a page in your browser.

If you choose to use any of the Falbricate Plugins, there might be some further requirements.
