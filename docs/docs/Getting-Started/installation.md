# Installation

To install the base for this library, you only need to enter the following 
line into your command line:

``` shell
npm install @falbricate/base
```

This gives you the base frame with basic functionality you can use to generate
your falsa objects.

Currently, there are no plugins available yet, but I'm working on it!
