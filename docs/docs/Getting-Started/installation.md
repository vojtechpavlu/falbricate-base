## Requirements

This project is built on top of base Node.js with TypeScript and is meant primarily for Node-based applications with
possible usage at static client-side applications with embedded JavaScript code.

To remain as lightweight as possible, to use the base framework you only need to have virtually any JavaScript runtime
environment - no matter if it's a Node.js or a page in your browser.

If you choose to use any of the Falbricate Plugins, there might be some further requirements.


# Installation

To install the base for this library, you only need to enter the following
line into your command line:

```shell
npm install @falbricate/base
```

This gives you the base frame with basic functionality you can use to generate
your falsa objects.


## Plugins

Currently, there are no plugins available yet, but I'm working on it!
