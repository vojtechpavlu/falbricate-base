# Introduction

Falbricate is a simple and lightweight ecosystem to Fabricate Falsa - to mock data
by the specified schema.


## About project

The name chosen for this project is a composition of words **_Falsum_** and **_Fabricate_** - simply
to indicate the intended purpose - to enable the user to generate any random data by declaring
just how the output data should look like - by providing a simple JSON-like schema.

This nature enables you to version the schema at the same pace the project needs will grow.

Currently, its main aim is to enhance mocking and preparation tools; with future extension to
other ecosystems to support the developer experience as much as possible.


## Motivation

> _I believe every developer needs to focus on turning his awesome ideas into implementation,
> not to spend hours on preparing and updating his data base for testing the masterpiece._

Motivation to build up this ecosystem is to provide the ability to create a data system in
the easiest possible manner - for development and testing.
